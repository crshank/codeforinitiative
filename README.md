## What is Code for Initiative?
**Code for Initiative** is a site that provides information about how programming can be used to supplement TTRPGs and help DMs, GMs, and players make tools that can help them roll digital dice, create random effects, or account for any number of other scenarios they may encounter in their games.

## Who runs Code for Initiative?
That would be me and only me. I’m [Craig](http://craigshank.com). I’m a self-taught, mostly casual programmer, but I have found that what I’ve learned has benefitted my work and hobbies tremendously. I wanted to share some tips for beginners because the hardest part of getting started with programming is finding projects to work on!

After I started DMing Dungeons & Dragons for my friends, I learned that I could use what I knew to help me with my prep and running sessions. Table Top RPGs attract creative thinkers and I thought other people might be able to learn some new skills while enjoying this great hobby.

## Why Python?
Frankly, Python is what I know best. The barriers for entry are relatively low with Python and it’s less intimidating than some other programming languages. Depending on the interest and response, other types of tutorials may be available in the future
